# Dams

Choropleth of number of dams per level 3 ecoregion.  This was completed for lab 4 in GHY 5818, however it is a work in progress for the final project in GHY 5818.  The final map will incorporate multiple zoom levels with different symbolization.  After clicking on an ecoregion the user is zoomed to the location.  Next step is to add point features of dam removal locations at that zoom level.  I purposefully chose a basemap withouth political boundaries and no symbolization so that the outline of the ecoregions stick out.  This basemap will hopefully be replaced by a simpler, custom mapbox basemap with less colors while still displaying topography.
